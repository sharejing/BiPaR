First thing next morning Lu Liuliang with his wife and sons and his two friends Gu and Huang embarked on their journey to Yangzhou. South of the Yangtze even households of quite moderate means had their own boat. This was a land of lakes and rivers, criss-crossed in all directions by canals and waterways, where journeys were normally made not by land but by water, so that it was often said, 'the Northerner goes a-horseback, the Southerner by boat'. Their plan, when they reached Hangzhou, was to turn into the Grand Canal and travel northwards. While they were moored for the night outside the city, they heard some news. The Manchu Court had already sentenced a large number of those involved in the Ming History case, both officials and commoners. Zhuang Ting-long could not be executed because he was already dead, so they had broken open his coffin and gibbeted his corpse. His father had died in prison of maltreatment. Of the rest of the Zhuang family, which numbered some forty or fifty members, all the males over the age of fifteen had been beheaded; the females were being transported to Mukden to be the slaves of Manchu Bannermen.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 80, "text": "Lu Liuliang"}, {"answer_start": 80, "text": "Lu Liuliang"}, {"answer_start": 80, "text": "Lu Liuliang"}], "question": "Who listened attentively, with many a sigh and groan?", "id": "TEST_lu_ding_ji_43_QUERY_0_EN"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 360, "text": "Wei Zhongxian"}, {"answer_start": 360, "text": "Wei Zhongxian"}, {"answer_start": 360, "text": "Wei Zhongxian"}], "question": "Who had gained control of the Government by encompassing the deaths of good, loyal ministers?", "id": "TEST_lu_ding_ji_43_QUERY_1_EN"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 1257, "text": "Hangzhou"}, {"answer_start": 1257, "text": "Hangzhou"}, {"answer_start": 1257, "text": "Hangzhou"}], "question": "Where did Lu Liuliang with his wife and sons and his two friends Gu and Huang embark on their journey to?", "id": "TEST_lu_ding_ji_43_QUERY_2_EN"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 1567, "text": "because he was already dead"}, {"answer_start": 1599, "text": "they had broken open his coffin and gibbeted his corpse"}, {"answer_start": 1599, "text": "they had broken open his coffin and gibbeted his corpse"}], "question": "What is the final end of Zhuang Ting-long?", "id": "TEST_lu_ding_ji_43_QUERY_3_EN"}]}]}, {"title": "liao_bu_qi_de_gai_ci_bi_36", "paragraphs": [{"context": "“Oh, sure,” agreed Wilson hurriedly, and went toward the little office, mingling immediately with the cement color of the walls.

But even as he moved the jug aside and called for a servant to bring wine, he reflected to himself how strange it was that in all this time, while he had been making up one story after another, there had not been a sign of a single one of the women who normally worked at Vernal Delights. Perhaps they were lying low, afraid to become involved in a fracas that had already cost several lives. And then in came an old crone, a strange'looking creature, who did not so much as look at him, but merely nodded and muttered' 'What do you want?' 'Fetch us a couple of jugs of fresh wine!' ordered Trinket, and the old woman nodded and set off again. As he watched her leave the room, Trinket felt a sudden shock go through him, and a shudder run up his spine. He jumped violently to his feet. His new'found brothers asked him what the trouble was. 'It's that woman,' replied Trinket. 'She's one of the Satrap's men dressed up. I'm sure she's been spying on us. She knows everything!' Sangge and Galdan reacted with horror and alarm. 'Then she must die at once!' 'Not so fast' returned Trinket. 'Let's pretend not to have noticed. See how many of them there are. What they're up to.' His voice was trembling. If it had really been one of Wu's men, he would never have been so frightened. The truth was that he had recognized the old woman's way of walking, just as he had noticed something odd about the stranger leaving the 'marquee' the previous evening. The two were one and the same.

As he rose slowly to his feet, a large, slate-coloured tile—it must have been all of eighteen inches square—was seen to be adhering to his palm as if by magnetism.

Trinket uttered a loud cry of admiration: 'Excellent kungfu!' The rest of the company applauded with their hands. Father Illuminatus, with a little smile of triumph, made a slight movement of his hand, releasing the tile from the power which held it captive to his palm, so that it began to fall; but as it reached the level of his chest, he clapped his hands together against its edges. There was a sort of plopping noise and the tile crumbled and dropped in a shower of particles to the floor. This time the shouts of applause came from every side.

This was a small, level plain called the Locust Field, a mile or two outside the walls of Hejianfu, surrounded by hills and bordered with locust trees. Normally it was used by the townsfolk and the people from the villages round about for fairs and festivals.

Young Sir Zheng's arrival was greeted with applause and as soon as he stepped down from the carriage he was swal- lowed up by a crowd of enthusiastic supporters and carried off into the middle of the field.
