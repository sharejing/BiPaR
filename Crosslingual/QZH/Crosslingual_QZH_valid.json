The attempted assassination of the Emperor was indeed a very serious offence, and for this Oboi would undoubtedly have had to pay the penalty of death by the Slow Process.

However much Kang Xi disliked Oboi, he was not willing to go to these lengths, or to implicate so many others in the villain's downfall. Kang Xi himself had not held the reins of power for very long and every one of his actions had until now been vetted by Oboi. All the officials at Court had always taken their orders from Oboi.

'I see,' Trinket said to himself. 'So that's why I'm being treated SO'well. You want me to spy on the Emperor for you. I'm not sure I want to do that.' When he remembered how well Kang Xi had always treated him, he couldn't help having serious doubts about the whole business. Cai Dezhong now undertook to tell Trinket something about the history and traditions of the Society. The founder of the Society, he explained, was Marshal Zheng, whom the foreigners called Coxinga. (Trinket had already heard about Coxinga from Whiskers. It was only a few years since his death, and his reputation was still strong throughout the southern regions of China.) Some twenty or so years earlier Coxinga had led a patriot army South of the River to besiege Nanking, but in a heroic struggle, after coming within an ace of victory, he had been defeated and forced to fall back on Taiwan. He had founded the Society before leaving for Taiwan, adopting a plan presented to him by his military adviser Chen Jinnan, or the Helmsman as they now called him. Cai himself, the other Masters (including Brother Yin, the late Master of the Green Wood Lodge), and most of the senior members of the Society like Brother Li had been officers in the Marshal's Grand Army. Of the large number of soldiers of the Grand Army left behind on the mainland, only a fraction made their way down to Xiamen. The Helmsman had the Marshal's orders to contact these old soldiers of the Grand Army and recruit them into the Society. Anyone who had been in the Grand Army could become a member automatically. Anyone else wishing to join had to be first introduced by sponsors and then undergo a period of probation during which he was carefully investigated. This was a precaution against letting in Government spies.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 1035, "text": "Marshal Zheng"}, {"answer_start": 1035, "text": "Marshal Zheng"}, {"answer_start": 1035, "text": "Marshal Zheng"}], "question": "“国姓爷”是谁？", "id": "VALID_lu_ding_ji_726_QUERY_0_CROSS_QZH"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 888, "text": "Cai Dezhong"}, {"answer_start": 888, "text": "Cai Dezhong"}, {"answer_start": 888, "text": "Cai Dezhong"}], "question": "谁给韦小宝讲了天地会的历史和规则？", "id": "VALID_lu_ding_ji_726_QUERY_1_CROSS_QZH"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 2327, "text": "This was a precaution against letting in Government spies."}, {"answer_start": 2327, "text": "This was a precaution against letting in Government spies"}, {"answer_start": 2327, "text": "This was a precaution against letting in Government spies"}], "question": "外人入会为什么要查察明白？", "id": "VALID_lu_ding_ji_726_QUERY_2_CROSS_QZH"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 1035, "text": "Marshal Zheng"}, {"answer_start": 1077, "text": "Coxinga"}, {"answer_start": 1077, "text": "Coxinga"}], "question": "天地会的创始祖师是谁？", "id": "VALID_lu_ding_ji_726_QUERY_3_CROSS_QZH"}]}]}, {"title": "ha_li_bo_te_156", "paragraphs": [{"context": "\"But this is important.\"\"Something you have to say is more important than the Ministry of Magic, Potter.\"Look,\" said Harry, throwing caution to the winds, \"Professor -- it's about the Sorcerer's tone --\"Whatever Professor McGonagall had expected, it wasn't that.

He therefore set about hunting for one in the remoter towns and cities of East Zhejiang; but there, too, not a single copy was to be had. In the end, disconsolate and now nearly penniless, he was forced to acknowledge himself beaten and to make his way back home. It was at this low point in his fortunes that he had a sudden stroke of luck. Putting up one night on his homeward journey at an inn, he chanced to observe the landlord nodding his head and rocking himself to and fro as he read from some book. The book turned out on inspection to be the Epitome of Ming History, and when he asked to borrow it for a few moments to have a look at it, it proved, to his boundless delight, to be the original edition. He calculated that if he asked to buy it the innkeeper would probably refuse; and in any case he wouldn't be able to buy it because he hadn't got the money. The only thing was to steal it. So he tiptoed from his bed at dead of night, took the book, and slipped from the inn without being observed. Wu was pretty sure that all the relevant officials in Zhejiang Province had received Zhuang's bribes. 'Very well,' he thought to himself: 'in for a penny, in for a pound!' and resolved to take the case all the way to Peking.

Acting on Cheng Weifan's advice, old Zhuang had long before this sent copies of the new edition to the Board of Rites, the Court of Censors, and the Chancellery, and suitable douceurs to the relevant officials and secretaries. Once more Wu had got a nose full of soot for his pains; and as he now had no money left for his journey back home, he was faced with the prospect of becoming a down-and-out in a city in which he was still a stranger. The Manchu Court was at this period extremely severe in its treatment of Chinese intellectuals. Normally the punishment for the slightest infringement of a taboo found in their writings would be summary execution by beheading.

'Laurie,' continued Kang Xi, to Trinket's dismay, 'this is a highly confidential matter. You're the only person I can trust with it.' 'Yes, Majesty. 1 understand. But the trouble is, I don't know where the Old Whore is. She could be anywhere by now. That fat lover of hers, the one who helped her escape, is capable of all manner of strange tricks.' 'Yes, I know. She may have vanished into the wilds, she may be hiding somewhere in the mountains. It will be hard to find her. But there must be clues. You just have to follow them up. Take a company of soldiers, take a whole regiment if you need to, go to that island and wipe out that whole Mystic Dragon gang. But be sure to interrogate them first. That's the way to find out where she is.' Colonel Trinket looked an extremely doubtful starter for this particular mission. Kang Xi tried to jolly him along. 'Look, Laurie, I know this is a tough one. It's like asking you to fish a needle out of the sea. But you're the man for it, I know you are. You're the one I turn to when all else fails. You're so smart, I know you can do it. I won't even set you a time limit. First you must set off towards the north'east, so that it looks as if you're on some other mission. Then when you're beyond the Pass and reach the city of Mukden, you can put your force together there and choose a good moment to take their island. Wipe these Mystic Dragons out! I want them broken!'Trinket could see that all this flattery was for a purpose. There was obviously no refusing.

Wu Zhirong gave the law officers in charge of the case to understand that the 'Mr Zhu' referred to was Zhu Youming. Moreover he pointed out that the name Youming, which means 'Guiding Light', could be construed to mean 'Supporting the Ming' and had obviously been assumed by Zhu in defiance of the Manchu Court. As a consequence Zhu Youming and all five of his sons were beheaded and the Zhu family fortune, amounting to more than a hundred thousand taels, was awarded by the Manchu Court to Wu Zhirong.
