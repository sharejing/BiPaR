Trinket immediately leapt up and grappled with her. She aimed a quick Ring Chain Double Kick at his face. He dodged out of the way, at the same time twisting back her left forearm. The Little Countess had obviously been taught these moves by an excellent Shifu, and she was a far better fighter than Trinket. In serious combat, he would not have stood a chance. But he was not too bad at this kind of close scrapping. The Little Countess managed to give him two hard blows to the chest, but then he succeeded in seizing her right arm and twisting it back.

I was a ... a whole boy till he had me taken to the Palace and snipped off all my best bits! I hate him. I hate him so much I'd like to chop him up into mincemeat and throw it into the water to feed the turdes.' The thicker he laid it on, Trinket calculated, the greater were his chances of staying alive. Sure enough, the men in the hall, when they heard this diatribe, looked at each other in some surprise. 'How long have you been a eunuch?' Tertius asked him. 'How long?' said Trinket. 'Less than six months. Yangzhou is where I come from. I was rounded up by him there and brought to Peking. Hot-piece momma! That stinking Oboi! Now that he's dead I hope he's climbing the mountain of knives. I hope he's boiling in oil. I hope they're rolling him on spiked boards . . .'

First thing next morning Lu Liuliang with his wife and sons and his two friends Gu and Huang embarked on their journey to Yangzhou. South of the Yangtze even households of quite moderate means had their own boat. This was a land of lakes and rivers, criss-crossed in all directions by canals and waterways, where journeys were normally made not by land but by water, so that it was often said, 'the Northerner goes a-horseback, the Southerner by boat'. Their plan, when they reached Hangzhou, was to turn into the Grand Canal and travel northwards. While they were moored for the night outside the city, they heard some news. The Manchu Court had already sentenced a large number of those involved in the Ming History case, both officials and commoners. Zhuang Ting-long could not be executed because he was already dead, so they had broken open his coffin and gibbeted his corpse. His father had died in prison of maltreatment.

Wang stood, adjusted the telescope to aim at the sun again, and tracked it until it dipped below the horizon.Night fell, and the bonfires across the plains mirrored the sky full of stars. Wang took off the smoked glass filter and continued to scan the skies. He was most interested in the flying stars, and shortly found two. He only had time to observe one of them briefly before it was dawn again. So he inserted the filter and continued to observe the sun... In this manner Wang performed astronomical observations for more than ten days, enjoying the thrill of discovery. Indeed, the fact that time within the game had been sped up helped with the observations, as the motion of celestial bodies became more apparent.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "The details in the image of the sun"}, {"answer_start": 0, "text": "The details in the image of the sun"}, {"answer_start": 0, "text": "The details in the image of the sun"}], "question": "什么使汪淼震惊？", "id": "TEST_san_ti_41_QUERY_0_CROSS_QZH"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 652, "text": "the flying stars"}, {"answer_start": 652, "text": "the flying stars"}, {"answer_start": 656, "text": "flying stars"}], "question": "他最感兴趣的是什么？", "id": "TEST_san_ti_41_QUERY_1_CROSS_QZH"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 688, "text": "two"}, {"answer_start": 688, "text": "two"}, {"answer_start": 688, "text": "two"}], "question": "他找到了几个飞星？", "id": "TEST_san_ti_41_QUERY_2_CROSS_QZH"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 951, "text": "the fact that time within the game had been sped up"}, {"answer_start": 965, "text": "time within the game had been sped up"}, {"answer_start": 951, "text": "the fact that time within the game had been sped up"}], "question": "什么有利于天文观测？", "id": "TEST_san_ti_41_QUERY_3_CROSS_QZH"}]}]}, {"title": "san_ti_294", "paragraphs": [{"context": "Yang waited until the others were gone and indicated that Ye should follow him a little distance away from the gate, clearly trying to avoid the sentries listening in.He no longer pretended that he didn’t know her. “Wenjie, let me be clear.

As the guests drank their tea and nibbled their sweetmeats, die evening drew on and the sun began to set. The magnificent bed of peonies visible just outside the 'marquee' glowed like a stretch of richly embroidered brocade. But it was a spectacle that aroused in Trinket's breast feelings not of aesthetic delight but of intense personal resentment, dating back to his childhood scrape with the monks. Now was his chance for revenge, he thought to himself. He could have the entire confounded bed of peonies dug up and burnt! But he needed some sort of pretext. Even as he was brooding over this, he heard the Provincial Governor's voice purring at his side: 'Your Excellency, I do believe I detect a touch of the Yangzhou accent in your intonation. Ours is indeed a rich and wonderful region, to produce not only such a wide variety of natural products, but also such a rich crop of great human talents to match them- persons such as your distinguished self.' Governor Ma had spent quite some time with Trinket over the past few days, and had indeed detected the remains of a Yangzhou twang, a hangover from his childhood that all Trinket's years in the Palace had failed to obliterate.

Father Illuminatus squatted down and struck the floor lightly with the palm of his left hand. As he rose slowly to his feet, a large, slate-coloured tile—it must have been all of eighteen inches square—was seen to be adhering to his palm as if by magnetism. Although not particularly heavy, the tile had been cemented firmly into the floor, yet the monk, by exercising some mysterious inner power, had been able not only to dislodge it from its setting, but to keep it adhering to his palm even after he had risen to his full height. Trinket uttered a loud cry of admiration: 'Excellent kungfu!' The rest of the company applauded with their hands. Father Illuminatus, with a little smile of triumph, made a slight movement of his hand, releasing the tile from the power which held it captive to his palm, so that it began to fall; but as it reached the level of his chest, he clapped his hands together against its edges. There was a sort of plopping noise and the tile crumbled and dropped in a shower of particles to the floor. This time the shouts of applause came from every side. Since only four or five inches on each side of the tile could have been in contact with the monk's hands when they struck it, there must have been quite extraordinary power in them to have reduced the whole of it to little pieces, the largest of which could not have been more than an inch or two square. Father Illuminatus walked over to the big retainer and pressed his palms together in monkish salutation. 'Now, sir, what's your name?' 'You have amazingly strong hands, Your Reverence,' said the man.

When news came overnight that he had been arrested and sentenced to imprisonment and confiscation, the whole city and all the area round about re-echoed to the sound of countless people rejoicing. Soon everyone had heard the story that the boy Emperor had ordered Oboi's arrest but that Oboi had used his mighty strength to resist and only finally been brought down by a handful of little eunuchs. The story became wonderfully embroidered in the telling. In every tea-house a dozen amateur storytellers, hands waving, spittle flying, demonstrated how Oboi had aimed a flying kick at the Emperor; how a few young eunuchs, each of them a master in the Martial Arts, had brought Oboi to the ground using the Clinging Vine technique; how Oboi had countered with a Threshing Carp movement; how the little eunuchs had then applied the method of attack which the manuals call the Panther Stealing the Heart; and so on, blow by blow, so that you would swear they had witnessed the whole struggle with their own eyes. During the last few days any eunuch who appeared in the market would be instantly surrounded by a knot of idlers eager for information about the circumstances of Oboi's arrest. Now that the guardsman had let it be known that the public benefactor who had succeeded in arresting Oboi was none other than the little eunuch riding by on the horse, the news, spreading like wildfire through the whole quarter, produced a storm of clapping and cheering. Never in the whole of his young life had Trinket experienced such a moment of glory. A feeling of elation swept over him and he began to believe that he really was a hero.

Four of the men exchanged doubtful glances, and shook their heads. These aren't ghosts,' said the old man. This is some sort of wizard! To light more than thirty candles in a matter of seconds! What do you make of this, Mr Xu?' Xu adopted an expression of utter bewilderment. 'Perhaps we have disturbed the master of the house in some way . . . Maybe we should kowtow at the shrines!' Just then, clearly audible above the driving rain, they heard a sound coming from the eastern wing of the house. It was the sound of women's voices wailing. It was a desolate, piercing sound. Trinket stood there with his mouth gaping, his face paralysed with fear. They all looked at one another in terror. Seconds later another sound reached them, this time from the western wing. It was the sound of another group of women weeping and sobbing.
