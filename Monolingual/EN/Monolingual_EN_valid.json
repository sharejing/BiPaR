The Princes and Ministers were unanimous in their praise of the Emperor's wisdom. The attempted assassination of the Emperor was indeed a very serious offence, and for this Oboi would undoubtedly have had to pay the penalty of death by the Slow Process. In addition to this his entire clan, old and young, and all of his associates and their clans, would have been put to death. The whole thing would probably have involved several thousand people. However much Kang Xi disliked Oboi, he was not willing to go to these lengths, or to implicate so many others in the villain's downfall. Kang Xi himself had not held the reins of power for very long and every one of his actions had until now been vetted by Oboi. All the officials at Court had always taken their orders from Oboi.

That means there's a real hope now of winning our country back for the Ming. They say if you know yourself and know your enemy you can win every battle: well, from now on we shall certainly know our enemy. I'm sure everyone here can understand what the Helmsman has in mind.' 'I see,' Trinket said to himself. 'So that's why I'm being treated SO'well. You want me to spy on the Emperor for you. I'm not sure I want to do that.' When he remembered how well Kang Xi had always treated him, he couldn't help having serious doubts about the whole business. Cai Dezhong now undertook to tell Trinket something about the history and traditions of the Society. The founder of the Society, he explained, was Marshal Zheng, whom the foreigners called Coxinga. (Trinket had already heard about Coxinga from Whiskers. It was only a few years since his death, and his reputation was still strong throughout the southern regions of China.) Some twenty or so years earlier Coxinga had led a patriot army South of the River to besiege Nanking, but in a heroic struggle, after coming within an ace of victory, he had been defeated and forced to fall back on Taiwan. He had founded the Society before leaving for Taiwan, adopting a plan presented to him by his military adviser Chen Jinnan, or the Helmsman as they now called him. Cai himself, the other Masters (including Brother Yin, the late Master of the Green Wood Lodge), and most of the senior members of the Society like Brother Li had been officers in the Marshal's Grand Army. Of the large number of soldiers of the Grand Army left behind on the mainland, only a fraction made their way down to Xiamen.

'Anyway,' he thought to himself, 'Misty didn't set a deadline for my return. For all he knows, I might have stayed on at Wutai for a few more days, or been carried off by Fat Dhuta.' As they travelled, he and Fang Yi chatted on every subject under the sun.

Now, as they rode slowly along side by side (with the rest of the party tactfully lagging a long way behind them), she behaved quite differently, talking happily and smiling gaily. In the Palace, Trinket had made a big thing of calling Fang Yi his wife, but mat had been mainly to tease her. Perhaps he had been a tiny bit flirtatious. But he was only very slightly in love, if at all. Today it was different.

He therefore set about hunting for one in the remoter towns and cities of East Zhejiang; but there, too, not a single copy was to be had.

It was at this low point in his fortunes that he had a sudden stroke of luck.

The book turned out on inspection to be the Epitome of Ming History, and when he asked to borrow it for a few moments to have a look at it, it proved, to his boundless delight, to be the original edition. He calculated that if he asked to buy it the innkeeper would probably refuse; and in any case he wouldn't be able to buy it because he hadn't got the money. The only thing was to steal it. So he tiptoed from his bed at dead of night, took the book, and slipped from the inn without being observed.

After waiting in Peking for a whole month, he received the same dismissive reply from all three departments. They had carefully examined the Epitome of Ming History by Zhuang Tinglong and found no infringements. The allegations made by the cashiered District Officer Wu were without foundation and maliciously inspired. As for his allegations about the bribery of officials, these appeared to be totally groundless. The Chancellery's finding was even more severe, stating that 'the said Wu, having himself been dismissed from office for corrupt practices, was evidently seeking to tar the honest majority of officials with the same brush.' Acting on Cheng Weifan's advice, old Zhuang had long before this sent copies of the new edition to the Board of Rites, the Court of Censors, and the Chancellery, and suitable douceurs to the relevant officials and secretaries. Once more Wu had got a nose full of soot for his pains; and as he now had no money left for his journey back home, he was faced with the prospect of becoming a down-and-out in a city in which he was still a stranger. The Manchu Court was at this period extremely severe in its treatment of Chinese intellectuals.

Prince Kang and Songgotu took their leave of the Emperor several hundred paces before he reached his personal quarters, that inner sanctum where ordinary officials of the Court were not allowed, only the various Imperial consorts, eunuchs, and maids-in-waiting. Trinket went on in with Kang Xi. He had always imagined the Emperor's sleeping quarters to be a place of absolute luxury and splendour, gilded with gold and studded with precious stones, with so many lustrous pearls suspended on the walls that there would never be need of lamps at night. To his surprise he found it to be rather an ordinary room, apart from the bedding and coverlets, which were of yellow silk, embroidered with dragons and phoenixes. Trinket was greatly disappointed.

This software can also adjust the membrane so that it's transparent, but the degree of transparency can be tuned in the frequencies of the cosmic micro-wave background. ...Of course, as sophons fold and unfold into different dimensions, they can display even more amazing 'miracles.' The software for accomplishing these is still being developed, but these 'miracles' will create a mood sufficient to divert human scientific thought onto the wrong path. This way, we can use the Miracle Plan to effectively restrain scientific endeavors outside of physics on Earth.\"\"One last question: Why not send all four of the completed sophons to Earth?\"", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 130, "text": "the software to allow a sophon to unfold itself into two dimensions"}, {"answer_start": 130, "text": "the software to allow a sophon to unfold itself into two dimensions"}, {"answer_start": 130, "text": "the software to allow a sophon to unfold itself into two dimensions"}], "question": "How would this be accomplished?", "id": "VALID_san_ti_390_QUERY_0_EN"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 752, "text": "use the Miracle Plan"}, {"answer_start": 752, "text": "use the Miracle Plan"}, {"answer_start": 760, "text": "Miracle Plan"}], "question": "How does it effectively restrain scientific endeavors outside of physics on Earth.?", "id": "VALID_san_ti_390_QUERY_1_EN"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 270, "text": "the Earth"}, {"answer_start": 270, "text": "the Earth"}, {"answer_start": 270, "text": "the Earth"}], "question": "What can the huge plane wrap itself around after the unfolding is complete?", "id": "VALID_san_ti_390_QUERY_2_EN"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 867, "text": "Why not send all four of the completed sophons to Earth?"}, {"answer_start": 867, "text": "Why not send all four of the completed sophons to Earth?"}, {"answer_start": 867, "text": "Why not send all four of the completed sophons to Earth?"}], "question": "What is the one last question?", "id": "VALID_san_ti_390_QUERY_3_EN"}]}]}, {"title": "ha_li_bo_te_736", "paragraphs": [{"context": "With an earsplitting bang of metal on wood, they hit the thick tree trunk and dropped to the ground with a heavy jolt.
